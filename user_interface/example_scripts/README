This folder contains two example scripts demonstrating how users can use the
python scripts provided to create a netcdf file of uncertain data that can be 
given to the ALC UQ cloud deployment tool.

example_sample.py - An example script showing how to set up a monte-carlo
                    sampling run with various kinds of uncertain data

example_scan.py   - An example script showing how to set up a mulit-dimensional
		    parameter scan run.

DAKOTA_VARIED_EXAMPLE.nc - This is an example of the netcdf produced by example_sample.py
			   after DAKOTA has written varied values to it.
			   Each variable now has an additional 'values' data item containing
			   the varied data for the current iteration.
   			   Users code needs to be able to read a file like thie.
