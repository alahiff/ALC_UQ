This folder runs a simple DAKOTA workflow locally. It also contains a netcdf file
containing varied data corresponding to the example_sample.py case. The varied data is contained
within the 'values' entries for each variable.  This example is here named DAKOTA_VARIED_EXAMPLE.nc but 
in a real run it would have the same name as the input netcdf; DAKOTA.nc. The 'values' entry is just added.

To run this workflow simply execute the following command in this directory:

./run_test1.sh 

This will execute the following steps:

1) Copy all the needed python scripts from the above directory into this directory and the
files_for_dakota directory which contains the subset of these scripts which dakota will use.

2) Runs the example_sample.py script to generate a mock user input netcdf file with some 
uncertain data.

3) Runs the main.py script with this netcdf file to generate a DAKOTA input file

4) Runs DAKOTA with this input file on a simple 'code' which sums some sampled values
and prints their output to a file (DAKOTA_OUTPUT.dat)

After the run there should be 4 work directories with names like workdir_VVebUQ.1 containing
such output files. They will also each contain a copy of the user netcdf file DAKOTA.nc which has
been updated with 'values' entries containing the varied data for each variable.

Running clean.sh will restore the directory to its initial clean state. 

# To test your own user code --------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to test your own scripts for making an input netcdf file and reading varied data from it
you can modify the files in this directory to do this. You will need to download DAKOTA and have it
visible on your PATH in order for this to work. You will also need the directory

<DAKOTA VERSION>/share/dakota/Python/dakota/interfacing

on your PYTHONPATH

1) Modify interface_test.sh to copy your python script for making an input netcdf to this 
directory instead of example_sample.py:

delete line 
       
       cp ../example_sample.py .

Replace with a line to copy your own code

2) Modify interface_test.sh to run this code instead to generate your netcdf file:

replace

	python example_sample.py

with 
        python <yourcode.py>

3) Modify the file files_for_dakota/interface_test.py to run your code for reading the varied
data from the updated netcdf file.

Replace the line:

	os.system('python mycode.py')

With a line to call your interface code.
